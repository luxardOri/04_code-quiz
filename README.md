# Week-4-Challange

## Description

This is a timed quiz. With javascript skills, I am to make a quiz that is timed, that will hold high scores in local storage. There should be a variety of questions and users are to select from multiple answers. Users will be penalized by reducing time from the timer, if they get an answer wrong.

## Installation

No installations needed, but will need access to final project link and github. That will be provided in the Usage section.
